## Dictionaries {#dictionaries}

A `r ref("Dictionary")` is a key-value data structure used by mlr3.
If you have been following along with this book, you have most likely already been using them.
For example, the three pre-defined dictionaries `r ref("mlr_tasks")`, `r ref("mlr_learners")` and `r ref("mlr_resamplings")` are meant to give you a central place to look at for tasks, available learners and resamplings, respectively.
The convenience functions like `r ref("tsk()")`,`r ref("lrn()")` and `r ref("rsmp()")` use these in the background, too.
This section should give you an overview about our implementation of dictionaries and why we are using dictionaries in mlr3 in contrast to other key-value stores.
